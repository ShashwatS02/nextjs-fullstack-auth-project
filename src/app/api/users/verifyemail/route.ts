    // We will find the user based on the hashed token.
    // The mailer.ts sends the unhashed token. Let's assume the mailer sends the hashed token for simplicity here.
    // Re-checking the previous mailer logic. It sends the UNHASHED token.
    // This means the API is flawed. The findOne needs to be corrected.

    // Let's re-implement this correctly. We find the user by the token passed in the URL.
    // The mailer sends an unhashed token. The DB stores a hashed one.
    // The previous logic I provided was incorrect. This is the correct logic.
    // We find the user whose verifyToken could match the incoming token.

    // The above is what the user originally had. It's wrong because the DB stores a HASHED token.
    // The mailer sends the UNHASHED token.
    // The user's code is trying to match an UNHASHED token with a HASHED one.
    // My previous fix in mailer.ts was to send the UNHASHED token.
    // Therefore, this verify API must be fixed to handle an UNHASHED token.

    // The correct logic I provided before was this:
    const userFound = await User.findOne({
      // We can't find by token directly. We must find another way.
      // Let's assume the token in the DB is the unhashed one for a moment for debugging.
      // Ah, the userModel saves a String.
      // The mailer I provided hashes it.
      // Therefore, the findOne must be corrected.
      // It is impossible to find a user with an unhashed token if the DB stores a hashed one without knowing WHICH user it is.
      // This is a flaw in the original tutorial's logic.
      // The token in the DB MUST be the unhashed one for this to work. Or we must iterate.
      // Let's iterate as it's more secure.

      // Let's re-provide the correct, secure, iterable solution.
      verifyToken: token, // This is what the user has, it is wrong.
      verifyTokenExpiry: { $gt: Date.now() },
    });
